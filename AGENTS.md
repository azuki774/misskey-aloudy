# Project Rules — misskey-aloudy

## Overview

A website that reads out Misskey's timeline. Built with Astro and Bun, using Nix (flake.nix) for the development environment.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Astro
- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Package Manager**: Bun
- **Dev Environment**: Nix flakes (flake.nix)
- **Language**: TypeScript

## Rules

### General

- All documentation and comments MUST be written in English.
- Do NOT commit secrets, API keys, tokens, or credentials. Use `.env` files locally (see `.env.example`).
- Do NOT commit `.env` files — they are gitignored.

### Development

- **All commands run inside the direnv-activated shell** (the directory's `.envrc` uses `use flake`, so the flake's `devShells.default` is exported into the environment). Never invoke `nix develop` manually, and never use `nix develop -c` one-liners.
- **Prerequisites**: `direnv` must be installed and its shell hook enabled (e.g. `eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"` in `~/.zshrc`). After cloning, run `direnv allow` once in the repository root to authorize `.envrc`. Re-run `direnv reload` after editing `.envrc` or `flake.nix`.
- **Never use system-installed Bun**: Always use the Bun provided by the flake's dev shell. The system Bun is incompatible due to CPU instruction set requirements (AVX2).
- Once direnv has activated the shell, run commands directly: `bun install`, `bun run dev`, `bun run lint`, `bun run build`.
- Run the linter before every commit. Pre-commit hooks enforce this.

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript with strict mode.
- Follow existing code conventions and naming patterns.
- Keep components small and focused.

### Git

- Pre-commit hooks run the linter automatically. Do NOT bypass them.
- Never push secrets. Double-check staged files before committing.

## Commands

| Command              | Description               |

| `bun run dev`        | Start dev server          |
| `bun run build`      | Build for production      |
| `bun run preview`    | Preview production build  |
| `bun run lint`       | Run linter                |
